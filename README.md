### Experiment 1: Basic Operations on Images  
**Aim:** To perform basic pixel-level arithmetic, logical, and geometric operations on digital images.

### Experiment 2:  
**Aim:** A. To plot the histogram of the given image and to perform histogram equalization. 
         B. To apply Geometric transforms on the given image. 

### Experiment 3:  
**Aim:** A. To study spatial domain low pass filtering of an image with mean, median filters. 
            Compare the performance of these two filters. Observe the effect of varying mask size on the filtered image.
         B. To study spatial domain high pass filtering of an image with sharpening filter.
