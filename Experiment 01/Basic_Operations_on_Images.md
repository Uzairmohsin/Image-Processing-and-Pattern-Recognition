# Digital Image Processing – Experiment 1

## Basic Operations on Images

This project demonstrates **basic digital image processing operations** performed on synthetic and natural images using **Python and OpenCV**.

### Aim
To apply pixel-level **arithmetic, logical, and geometric operations** on digital images.

### Operations Performed
- Arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Image resizing
- Image rotation and translation

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

### Learning Outcome
- Understanding of image preprocessing techniques
- Hands-on experience with OpenCV
- Foundation for computer vision and machine learning tasks
